- Primary objectives: To provide a platform for interdisciplinary exchange between AI and marine technology researchers, highlight recent advances in AI applications for underwater robotics, environmental monitoring, and ocean data analysis and explore challenges and future directions for intelligent systems in marine environments.
   
- Intended scope: This workshop focuses on the application of artificial intelligence techniques—including machine learning, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and swarm intelligence—to key areas of marine technology. Topics include autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), underwater object recognition, intelligent sensor networks, oceanographic data processing, and marine environmental forecasting. Other topics using AI and machine learning for helping or improving all marine, aquaculture, fisheries and seafood solutions in planting, growing, harvesting, health as well as farming environment are also welcome.
    
- Target audience: The workshop targets AI researchers, marine scientists, robotics engineers, graduate students, and professionals in oceanic research and technology development. It will also appeal to those interested in applying AI methods to real-world physical and environmental challenges.
